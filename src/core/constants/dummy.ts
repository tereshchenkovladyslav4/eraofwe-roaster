        title: 'Stenophylla: History’s Solution To Modern Coffee Production',
        created_at: '2021-06-05T13:01:01Z',
        description: `<p>Climate change has been&nbsp;a&nbsp;threat growing faster than ever as time passes. While we&nbsp;often discuss&nbsp;rising sea levels and erratic weather patterns, the effect of climate change on our food crops is often overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Coffee, an essential commodity for a&nbsp;majority of the world, is one such crop being battered by the effects of climate change, and scientists are actively looking for ways to combat this—one such way is the discovery of a recently “re-discovered” variety called&nbsp;stenophylla.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Coffee is a notoriously difficult crop to cultivate and rising global temperatures only worsen growing conditions for farmers. With rising temperatures comes drought, destructive storms, and a reduction in pollination. Increased temperatures also lower the quality of the beans harvested.&nbsp;Hotter weather ripens berries faster and negatively impacts the taste of the final cup. Total&nbsp;yield&nbsp;also drops in&nbsp;response to hot weather,&nbsp;and the coffee plants face threats from new pests and diseases. When it comes to rainfall, both too much and too little rain can ruin&nbsp;a coffee harvest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As&nbsp;many&nbsp;may know,&nbsp;a majority&nbsp;of the world’s coffee is of two main types:&nbsp;<em>Arabica&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Robusta</em>.&nbsp;<em>Arabica&nbsp;</em>is best grown in cool, shady environments like the Ethiopian highlands where it originated while&nbsp;<em>Robusta&nbsp;</em>is a hardier crop that grows in slightly warmer environments with plenty of rainfall throughout&nbsp;the year. Both these sub-species of coffee are now battling the effects of climate&nbsp;change. To continue, the coffee industry now has to look towards more climate-resistant varieties to remain viable.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Robusta&nbsp;</em>is a more resistant variety but even it can’t really withstand climate change and anyway, it’s no match for&nbsp;<em>Arabica&nbsp;</em>when it comes to flavor and versatility.&nbsp;What we need is a climate-resistant variety of coffee that can withstand global warming while also being flavorful and practical to cultivate. But can we find something like this? The answer, surprisingly,&nbsp;might be hidden away in the history of coffee back in the&nbsp;19th&nbsp;century.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Coffea&nbsp;Stenophylla</em>&nbsp;was first scientifically described in 1834 in Sierra Leone, where it’s also known as highlands coffee. Back then, this wild variety was cultivated at scale across western Africa and&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;exported to France. Historical records describe its flavor as comparable to or even better than&nbsp;<em>Arabica</em>.&nbsp;<em>C.&nbsp;Stenophylla</em>&nbsp;is also much more resistant to temperature than both&nbsp;<em>Arabica&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Robusta</em>.&nbsp;However, it takes longer to grow and has a smaller yield per harvest so over time its cultivation died out. That is, until now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In modern times,&nbsp;<em style="background-color: rgb(255, 229, 229);">Stenophylla</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is seeing renewed interest as an ideal solution to the climate change problem in the coffee industry.&nbsp;It’s able to withstand both rising temperatures and drought, meaning it could be&nbsp;used to revitalize coffee cultivation in drier and hotter regions.&nbsp;<em>Stenophylla&nbsp;</em>shrubs&nbsp;are&nbsp;highly&nbsp;dependent on rainfall cycles, and produce dark black berries when ripe.&nbsp;Their star-shaped flowers, narrow leaves, and dark berries are used to identify the plant in the wild.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our understanding of the&nbsp;<em>Stenophylla&nbsp;</em>sub-species is very limited. Wild plants are now being studied in Sierra Leone to better understand the plant’s life cycle and&nbsp;viability&nbsp;for commercial cultivation.&nbsp;As a perennial crop, it will take a few years to truly analyze the viability of the plant. In addition, farmer education and incentivizing the cultivation of&nbsp;<em>Stenophylla&nbsp;</em>needs to be put in place to encourage farmers to experiment with this variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the crop is properly studied, we can also explore the possibility of hybridization with the existing coffee varieties across the globe.&nbsp;We know that small studies have found that it’s almost indistinguishable from&nbsp;<em>Arabica&nbsp;</em>so this is even more incentive to study&nbsp;<em>Stenophylla&nbsp;</em>and experiment with its cultivation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Results are sparse but promising, and&nbsp;<em>Stenophylla&nbsp;</em>could truly be the long-sought&nbsp;solution to climate change that the coffee industry has been searching for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>`,

        title: 'How a Coffee Program Can Save Your Business',
        created_at: '2021-06-09T13:01:01Z',
        description: `<p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Learn how adding a coffee program to your offerings can be a way to create additional revenue.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coffee has a way of connecting people. This drink is the world's second most consumed beverage, and for a good reason. Selling coffee has potential to increase your revenue, and draw attention to other products you sell even if you don't offer food or beverages already. You may be missing out on an opportunity to get the regular set of patrons you've been missing with your business already. We share some reasons why you should consider adding a coffee program to your business, and some simple ways to get it started.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee Programs Create Community&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As we said before, a lot of people drink coffee. For cafe goers, many of them return to their favorite places several times a week to get their daily fix. For business owners of more specific products, offering coffee may be a way to bring repeat customers to their businesses. Coffee is also an incredibly social environment. Bringing a coffee program to your business also gives you a chance to create a welcoming space where people can come together to connect. You'll begin to see familiar faces, and you'll also get an added level of hospitality at your business. You'll be able to connect with patrons over more than just coffee, but who you are as a person.&nbsp;</p><p>Often time, community groups and gatherings like to host events or meetings at coffee shops. If you sell coffee, your business may also become one of these meeting grounds, attracting an even larger customer base. A coffee program is a way to make your space more than just a place for selling items, but a place where community can connect. Bonus points if your current offerings reflect a subject that people like to bond over as well, such as outdoors sports or books.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee is a Humane Business&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coffee is an industry filled with people who seek positive change in their communities. People hold more and more businesses accountable for their actions nowadays. They demand transparency in their products, and want sustainable goods made by people who receive a living wage. Therefore, selling coffees supplied by humanitarian businesses will also show your own dedication and commitment to being a better business.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee Validates Your Offerings&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When you create a coffee community, you also include yourself as a part of that community. People love to frequent businesses with the friendliest owners. Or, those whom they see are passionate and knowledgeable about their products. If you put in the work you need to establish a great coffee program, there is also a good chance that people will trust you to sell other items.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee Starts Conversations&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Having a coffee program opens up more conversations to be had over more than just coffee. Opportunities to discuss your other products may happen while you're preparing their beverage, while you're ringing up customers, or while they're drinking coffee. While a customer has the ability to shop through a store without talking to anyone, it is somewhat unavoidable to interact with someone serving them coffee. They have no choice but to chat with you during their transaction, which may give you a better understanding of what they may be interested in at your shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee Programs Bring Constant Business&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of business owners experience periods of slowness in the nature of what they're selling. For example, if they sell winter sports equipment, it will definitely be quieter in the summer. An ice cream store, on the other hand, is packed during the summer and inconsistent in the winter. Since coffee can be served both hot and iced, it is a beverage that is relevant&nbsp;year round. A coffee program will ensure that you'll always have some revenue coming in no matter what time of the year it is.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Where Do I Get Started?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is a considerable amount of work involved to get a coffee program started. It takes time to learn about the proper way to brew coffee. You must also factor in the skill of ordering the right amount of product based on consumer demand. Finally, you need to purchase equipment. While it may be a little intimidating to get your setup, it will definitely get easier in the long run. There are so many resources out there to help you with all of these initial hurdles. The rewards you gain afterwards are absolutely worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Equipment&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Most people like to start off with three simple pieces of equipment to get their coffee program started. These are an espresso machine, a drip coffee maker, and a coffee grinder. All three of these items, however, are incredibly customizable. When trying to decide things like how big, expensive, or high tech your items should be, consider the space in which you will be selling. Wouldn't a giant four-group head espresso machine look a little silly in a small clothing store? Also take into account the volume you may be expecting for coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Coffee&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The coffee beans themselves are another incredibly customizable (and fun!) part of the experience. Coffee beans come from a variety of countries across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. You can also customize which beans you prefer based on dark roast, medium, or light. This is another item that you will want to consider volume when purchasing because beans should be used within three weeks of the time it got roasted.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Education&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You could have the nicest equipment and the most expensive roasted coffee. However, if you're not brewing it the right way, it could all go to waste. Coffee is like baking, in that brewing it requires weighing it for coffee "recipes." Luckily, there are countless resources on the web and in local communities. Many people are around to help you learn about how to use your equipment the right way, and how to select beans based on what your customers prefer. Try seeing if a wholesale provider offers a training program, or consider getting a coffee skills certification from the Specialty Coffee Association.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(40, 126, 212);">Conclusion: A Coffee Program is Worth It&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adding a coffee program is not only a way to increase revenue, but a chance for customers&nbsp;too&nbsp;connect&nbsp;with your brand on a personal level. Coffee is also a fun hobby that many people have adopted in the last few years. You may find yourself&nbsp;geeking&nbsp;out too over this popular and well-loved beverage!&nbsp;</p>`,

        description: `<p><strong><em>Why building a brand is important for a coffee business of any&nbsp;kind.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">A brand is a marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;that&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;and align with&nbsp;a particular company.&nbsp;In this case,&nbsp;that devotion is&nbsp;your coffee&nbsp;brand.&nbsp;Branding&nbsp;is one of the most valuable assets to your company; not only does it help differentiate you from the competition, it should also give your customers an idea of who you are&nbsp;and your company values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">What Does Branding in Coffee Mean?</strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Building a brand means making it recognizable to your customer. The customer should see your brand on a product and instantly&nbsp;trust&nbsp;it because they trust your brand. To achieve recognition and trust, you need clear and effective communication that will continuously reinforce your brand. When a customer is buying your coffee,&nbsp;in a surprising way,&nbsp;the coffee is the last thing they'll consume! Their senses will consume the brand first,&nbsp;everything from the packaging to the colors and the illustrations and even your mission statement. Often,&nbsp;that is the difference between&nbsp;a customer’s choice to&nbsp;buy your coffee and&nbsp;over another brand. You can make the best coffee&nbsp;in the world. However,&nbsp;if the customer doesn't like the look of your brand, they&nbsp;less likely to drink&nbsp;your coffee. Thus, your brand is what differentiates you and gives you a competitive edge in the market.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">What Makes a Brand Sell?</strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Customers are attracted to brands that they share values with. Hence, when you build a brand, you need to communicate your values to make an emotional connection with your customers; nurture your brand like your coffee plants with love and care. Otherwise, your brand will not grow. A brand like&nbsp;Coca-Cola&nbsp;did not stop advertising and promoting themselves&nbsp;when they became the most recognized&nbsp;soda brand in the world. Studies have shown that 59% of consumers prefer to buy from a brand they already know; thus, communicating with your customers will be a continuous activity to grow your business.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Here are the key points you need to keep in mind to build a winning brand:&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Differentiation</strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">To&nbsp;stand out, you need to know who you're competing against,&nbsp;and what the general industry trend&nbsp;is. This is&nbsp;so you can understand how to be different while still appealing to your target demographic. When you have a clear understanding of the competition you are up against, you can focus on figuring out your target demographic and tailor a message to meet their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">If you’re a coffee producer, the goal of branding your&nbsp;business&nbsp;is to support&nbsp;and target&nbsp;the coffee roasters you are selling your beans to. Doing this, in turn,&nbsp;gives them a story&nbsp;to work with.&nbsp;That story&nbsp;demonstrates to their large global clients that they are sourcing quality coffee from a place that&nbsp;aligns with their values. Often time, those values mean&nbsp;farming in a sustainable method at a competitive price.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">The Era of We platform targets many members of the supply chain with an emphasis on the&nbsp;coffee drinker&nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;your branding should be targeted towards the&nbsp;coffee consumer&nbsp;as well since they are the&nbsp;final&nbsp;client. The better you can support the roaster, the better they can help you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Build a brand message</strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">This&nbsp;involves&nbsp;your core message that you want to communicate with the&nbsp;consumer. It consists of your mission statement in a unique voice that the&nbsp;consumer cannot confuse for some other brand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">You should be focusing on three major questions when building your brand message:&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">What is your purpose&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">How are you different&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">What problem do you&nbsp;solve&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Based on these answers, you can draft a concise mission statement that defines the purpose of your existence. Therefore,&nbsp;it&nbsp;gives the audience a reason to trust you. When you can communicate this trust clearly with them, you can win their loyalty and retain them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">By doing so, you'll also create a unique voice that will make your company more human.&nbsp;It then&nbsp;translates&nbsp;as a person with an individual and unique personality, making your business more relatable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">A consistent and emotionally appealing narrative</strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Creating an emotional connection with your customers through consistency is key to brand building.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Understand your demographic and construct a narrative that will appeal to them. Preferably the narrative should be one they can connect with emotionally.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Use a consistent tone of voice and be authentic. The more you connect on a human level, the stronger the brand loyalty will be&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Write an authentic story and reinforce it throughout all your communications. Your story is your DNA, and it is what makes people care about it.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);"><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Once you have an emotional connection with your audience, they will&nbsp;want to know more about who you are.&nbsp;Remember, authenticity is key to building an emotional connection here!&nbsp;So simply, just be yourself. Don’t try to lie about what you stand for to appeal to someone else. People value the honesty of a business more than ever these days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">Era of We's vision is to present your estate to everyone who drinks your coffee,&nbsp;and to introduce you to those who don't know you yet.&nbsp;We want to give your unique brand a global reach to strengthen it so that the brand, in turn, supports the organic growth of your estate and company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26);">The stronger your brand is, the better&nbsp;you&nbsp;can present it to your customers&nbsp;and gain trust.&nbsp;</span></p>`,
