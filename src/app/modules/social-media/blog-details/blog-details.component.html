                                    When someone mentions barbecue images comes to the mind like cooking at the backyard
                                    grill, a social gathering, cooking outdoors and cooking meat slowly over wood and
                                    smoke that adds flavor to the food. Different cooks have different preferences and
                                    style in their cooking. Some prefer rubbing the seasoning whether wet or dry prior
                                    to cooking and some prefers to soak the meat first in special marinades that could
                                    be sops, mops and finishing. The preparation and ingredients for marinating may
                                    differ from region to region the preferred wood to be used can also differ. However,
                                    no perfect barbecue will taste as good without the perfect barbecue sauce.

                                    applied to the meat while being cooked with the exemption of tomato based barbecue
                                    sauces as tomato based sauces burns easier than the other kinds of sauces. Barbecue

                                <p class="fnt-14 fnt-600 text-clr334">
                                    Tomato based barbecue sauce is the most widely used. Some say that it is the most
                                    popular. Its popularity however may be due to the simplicity of preparation and
                                    besides; tomatoes are ingredients that could easily be found. The point to remember
                                    in preparing tomato-based barbecue sauces is to cook the tomatoes very well in order
                                    for the flavor to blend with the other ingredients. Tomato based barbecue sauces are
                                    acidic. Because of this, it has the property to breakdown all the flavor of other
                                    ingredients blending them with its own. But because of its propensity to burn, limit
                                    the usage of tomato based barbecue sauce while cooking. To make it even more
                                    flavorful, prepare tomato barbecue sauces a day in advance.
