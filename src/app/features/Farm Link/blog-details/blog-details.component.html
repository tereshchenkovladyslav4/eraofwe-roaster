                                When someone mentions barbecue images comes to the mind like cooking at the backyard
                                grill, a social gathering, cooking outdoors and cooking meat slowly over wood and smoke
                                that adds flavor to the food. Different cooks have different preferences and style in
                                their cooking. Some prefer rubbing the seasoning whether wet or dry prior to cooking and
                                some prefers to soak the meat first in special marinades that could be sops, mops and
                                finishing. The preparation and ingredients for marinating may differ from region to
                                region the preferred wood to be used can also differ. However, no perfect barbecue will
                                taste as good without the perfect barbecue sauce.

                                are tomato, vinegar and mustard based sauces. To give the barbecue its distinctive taste
                                and prevent the meat from burning easily, barbecue sauces are applied to the meat while
                                being cooked with the exemption of tomato based barbecue sauces as tomato based sauces
                                burns easier than the other kinds of sauces. Barbecue sauce preparation can either be
                                sweet, sour, tangy, spicy, hot, thick or thin. The varieties are almost endless which

                                Tomato based barbecue sauce is the most widely used. Some say that it is the most
                                popular. Its popularity however may be due to the simplicity of preparation and besides;
                                tomatoes are ingredients that could easily be found. The point to remember in preparing
                                tomato-based barbecue sauces is to cook the tomatoes very well in order for the flavor
                                to blend with the other ingredients. Tomato based barbecue sauces are acidic. Because of
                                this, it has the property to breakdown all the flavor of other ingredients blending them
                                with its own. But because of its propensity to burn, limit the usage of tomato based
                                barbecue sauce while cooking. To make it even more flavorful, prepare tomato barbecue
                                sauces a day in advance.

                                is barbecuing all about. The flavor has to come from the wood not the bottle.
